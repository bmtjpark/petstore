# About

A sample Java application to demonstrate applying the principles and practices described in Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce book, [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/).

Have a look at [Simple PetStore](https://github.com/testinfected/simple-petstore), a fork of the PetStore written with simple tools
and frameworks (Simpleframework, JDBC, Buildr, Velocity and Sitemesh).

This version is built on top of Spring MVC 3.0, Spring Core 3.0, Hibernate 3.5, Velocity 1.6, Sitemesh 2, Bean Validation API 1.0 and Maven 2/3. This technological stack has been chosen with the following objectives in mind:

* Make the point that technologies should not be preventing you from applying the best practices described in the book
* Don't make it too easy, like in real life ;-)
* Make it relevant and useful to the large number of Java developers using the Spring+Hibernate combo
* Learn Spring MVC myself

## Getting Started

See the [wiki](https://github.com/testinfected/petstore/wiki/_pages) for information on building and starting the application.
